This is my COVID-19 Help app prototpye with some screenshots of its screens and navigation in figma.
It provides these things:
1. Focus on helping elderly people to be prepared on COVID-19
2. Very simple easy to use UI
3. Very clear explanation and use of ToolBar
4. Properly Sized Text and Icons for Seniors
5. Ability for seniors to call their most used conctact to help them
